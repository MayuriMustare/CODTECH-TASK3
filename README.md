# Overview of the Project:
# Project: AI CHATBOT WITH NLP
# A] Objective:
To develop a simple AI chatbot capable of understanding user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and providing appropriate responses based on detected intents.

# B] Key Activities:
1. Preprocessing and Setup: Download necessary NLP resources from NLTK, such as tokenizers and the WordNet lexical database. Load the SpaCy language model for efficient text processing.
2. Intent Detection: Analyze user input to detect intent using- Tokenization and lemmatization for understanding the meaning of words. Keyword-based matching for common intents like greetings, farewells, and gratitude.
3. Response Generation: Use predefined responses for each recognized intent, Randomly select a response from the list of possible responses for variety.
4. Chatbot Interaction: Create a continuous loop for user interaction, Allow users to end the conversation by typing "exit", Provide feedback for unrecognized inputs and prompt users to rephrase.
5. Error Handling: Handle unknown intents gracefully by providing generic responses, Ensure the chatbot does not crash on unexpected inputs.

# c] Technologies Used:
1. Programming Language: Python-Ideal for NLP tasks due to its extensive library support.
2. NLP Libraries: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)-Provides tools for tokenization, lemmatization, and accessing lexical databases like WordNet. SpaCy-Efficient for advanced text processing tasks, including tokenization, lemmatization, and entity recognition.
3. Random Module: Used to randomly select responses from predefined lists, adding variety to the chatbot's replies.
4. Predefined Response System: A dictionary-based system for associating intents with possible responses.
5. User Interaction: Command-line interface for real-time user input and chatbot responses.
